## Data Management Plan

# Project Description
This is a collection of photographs, newspaper articles, and artworks that express how logging has affected communities in Oregon. Some communities of note are logging workers, Indigenous tribes and local Oregonians. Each of these groups are impacted by the environmental, physical, and economic tolls of logging. Viewers of our collection will be immersed into a new perspective of historical documents that show how the lumber industry has shaped Oregon and its residents. Groups that may find this collection particularly interesting are conservationists, historians, and people affected by the logging across Oregon. These groups may use it for research papers, or to learn more about the state's history. The contents of this collection comes from Oregon Digital, University of Oregon’s Oregon Digital Newspaper Program, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and the World Forestry Center.

This data is displayed on our website that can be viewed here: https://gbarrus.github.io/logging-oregon/. Our website outputs our data in a format that is viewable for users to access. Additionally, we have used google drive to store the collection’s items and draft descriptions. Our data consists of PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs, and  MP4. 

# Period of Data Retention
