## About Our Collection

# Project Manager - Eva Andrews

Being from Utah, she has grown up exploring forests and grew her passion for the outdoors when she  came to college here in Oregon.

# Collections Manager - Cora Stevens

# Collection Description: 
Our collection is based on a variety of photographs, newspaper articles, and artworks that express how logging has affected communities throughout the beautiful state of Oregon. Some communities of note are logging workers, Indigenous tribes, and local Oregonians. People who view our collection will be immersed into a new perspective of historical documents that show how the lumber industry has shaped Oregon and its residents. To view our data, please access our repository through this link: https://github.com/gbarrus/logging-oregon. The contents of this collection comes from Oregon Digital, University of Oregon’s Oregon Digital Newspaper Program, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and the World Forestry Center. Our hope is that our viewers will be immersed into the history of logging in Oregon, and will be inspired to do their own research and explore further curiosities.

# Thank You!
Thank you to our instructor, Franny Gaede, for the unwavering support that we have received throughout our digital repository project. Additionally, we want to give thanks to the course support that we have received advice from the entire term as well, so thank you Rayne, Erin, and Gabriele! For our group, the classroom environment was extremely beneficial for the success of our project, and we could not thank our classmates and instructors enough for contributing to that as a whole. As a result, there has been immense interest in digital archival projects by all three of our team members because of this project. Lastly, thank you to all of our individual support systems that made it possible for us to succeed in this term, which allowed for us to succeed in a multitude of ways.
