description: "This is a collection of photographs, newspaper articles, and artworks that express how logging has affected communities in Oregon. Some communities of note are logging workers, Indigenous tribes and local Oregonians. Each of these groups are impacted by the environmental, physical, and economic tolls of logging. Viewers of our collection will be immersed into a new perspective of historical documents that show how the lumber industry has shaped Oregon and its residents. Groups that may find this collection particularly interesting are conservationists, historians, and people affected by the logging across Oregon. These groups may use it for research papers, or to learn more about the state's history. The contents of this collection comes from Oregon Digital, University of Oregonâ€™s Oregon Digital Newspaper Program, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and the World Forestry Center."
